It took a bit to untangle and separate the parts.  While two parts sounds okay it actually made it a little harder to put on overall. As with all mask fit will change for everyone's face. But the bottom looping over both ears is difficult and somewhat uncomfortable, I ended up leaving it looped on one ear only. Over both it also did not cover the side of my nose and parts of my cheeks. It was just stretched to far. The mouth hole could also be longer.

The mask itself is extremely wet, which makes it stick to your face well. But being in a colder climate that wetness is a little uncomfortable and has that feeling of wet hands or hair going out in the cold, a slight sting.

I would recommend having tissues nearby for when you remove the mask. The directions say to massage the residue into your face, but there is a lot left on your face when you remove it. You can massage it all in eventually or it just dries. But you will also see residue or skin peeling, there is just too much left after removing the mask. The residue left also is a bit tacky feeling left on your face.

Overall I didn't notice anything with my face that made these mask stand out. It mainly seemed the same as me applying my normal moisturizer just with a lot more hassle. 

Pretty much I would not recommend these mask. The closest I can get is if you are someone who likes using mask try it and see if it is better for you, but if you rarely or are someone not big into mask I would recommend a good moisturizer over this. It is also extremely expensive for an less than to average mask at 50 dollars per mask.",combination,fair

This has been one of the few that I have actually gone through the whole bottle. Most others I tried leave a white film or would pill when I added primer or makeup over. So because this didn’t do either, it was a major win for me. I like the thickness of the formula and how it feels when I’ve applied it. I know it might sound silly but I feel like I can tell I have a barrier of protection around my skin. This is super important to me, as is the 50 SPF, because I began using prescription retinol and sun protection is so important. 

My only complaint about this is that it tends to apply a bit oily. I have combo skin so sometimes I look dewy, other times just like a grease face after applying this.

I was very skeptical to try this as many people with my skin tone strongly suggested that it left a bad white cast on skin with more melanin. I would say, being Filipino, I’m pretty melinated. I have tan skin, but this product has no issues matching to my skin tone. I believe the matter of it not working on some people is because of incorrect application. A little really does go a long way. I started off with a small amount and slowly added more until I got a desired coverage. Think of it more as a serum then a moisturizer, you only put a small amount and not slather a lot on your face. Additionally, I warmed it up in my hands before application them patted it into my face. I do believe that this product with not work on someone who is extremely melinated and has a very deep tone to their skin.  The reason why I say this is that for people with darker skin, redness and irritation don’t appear as red, they appear as a dark purple or almost bluish color. Green will not be able to color correct that redness correctly therefore a different CC cream is needed. If you have tan skin and are hesitant to try this, I would recommend trying it, you can always return it anyways. Start small, then add more.",combination,tan

As far as packaging, it could use some work. I read in another review to only open the seal halfway to stop the product from spilling out. This has really helped me control how much I use. But the foil tube is starting to split a little bit at the sides and a tiny amount of product comes out.

I moved to a place higher up altitude wise (you’d never believe how much your hair, skin and nails react to a change in altitude after a month, none of my old products worked as well for me I had to find new things). The air and water where I live now is a bit harsh on my skin. So my lips got dryer than usual. This fixed that problem. I put it on every night. The tatcha one didn’t work for me at all. After 2 weeks my lips got worse with tat ha. After a few days of this my lips weren’t dry anymore. Honestly my only complaint is actually the size. There’s so much product and the shelf life is long. Which you think would be great right? But I have already left this in 2 places where I couldn’t go back to retrieve it. And I’m not going to have someone mail me back my used lip balm lol. I like this so much that I’ve repurchased. But it would be nice if it was half its size and cost less since I’m one to misplace and lose small items like this. Still 5 stars though. Me being ditzy and misplacing things has nothing to do with the fact that this feels nice on the lips and is very hydrating. And when I put it on at night it’s still there in the am.

After waxing my upper/lower lip, I reached for this because it had been a while since I had last used it, and I wanted to shrink my blackheads/pores across my nose/cheeks.

Nothing that can't be fixed using Aquaphor, Cetaphil cream, and sunscreen, but still, I should have been smarter to avoid the damage. The blackheads/pores on my nose/cheeks are much smaller though, so at least that's a win. 

Just remember that this should be used alone to stay on the safe side. I would also avoid using this in combination with any other active ingredients (Vitamin C, Vitamin A (retinol/retinoids), etc.).

However, I gave them a try and I’m so glad that I did. First off, one sheet goes a pretty long way. Don’t get me wrong - I do have a place in my heart for the Boscia blotting linens, but I usually have to use maybe two or three of the Boscia sheets (both sides, and I don’t even have full on oily skin, just combo/sensitive) and I only need one of these Tatcha sheets to absorb all of my oily bits. Secondly, they’re gentle on my sensitive skin and not perfumed. I love them.

So many of them strip your skin and obliterate your moisture barrier without really delivering anything a good exfoliant a few times a week doesn't. THAT SAID... this stuff is amazing. That's because it's not *really* a 'toner' in the sense that it's more of a hydrating, soothing essence that sinks into the skin and preps it for serums, treatments, and occlusives. It's just lovely.

But as I'm nearing 30 I've been upping my anti-aging game and stronger actives are stressing out my skin. I was experiencing a lot more sensitivity and irritation than I used to, and it's been quite a bit of trial and error trying to balance an effective routine with protecting my skin --but switching out my hyaluronic acid serum for this toner has definitely been a helpful step. It's extremely gentle and very quickly absorbed (unlike a lot of serums). I use it after cleansing then let my face completely dry and it's a nice little buffer before I slather my face in harsher stuff. FAB products tend to work as advertised, and this is no exception.

I have the Fat Water and the Hydravizor moisturizer and I have now added the overnight gel-cream to my routine. I have been using the night cream for almost 2 weeks now and I am absolutely in love. First, I absolutely love the smell and the secure packaging the product comes in. I think now more than ever, we need to be mindful of how we are treating our planet so I thought Riri made such a conscientious effort here. Now, the product itself is unlike anything I have ever had before. I've been using the Origins Ginzing moisturizer for a long time and while it did serve its function I didn't like the fact that it would feel really greasy on the skin but because I would only use it as a night cream I didn't really care. The Fenty overnight cream smells amazing, the cream itself feels really lightweight when you are applying it and it spreads very easily. What I really liked about this cream is that the product actually absorbs into your skin. After like 20 minutes I could touch my face and the product had locked into my skin. My skin felt hydrated but not greasy, soft, and supple. I highly recommend this product and will definitely re-purchase in the future. I think Fenty Skin is it for me.",combination,fair

This is the holy grail facial oil for dry skin! A little goes a long way and leaves my skin dewy without being shiny when I apply it.

After using this for about 2 months the results are really stunning, not only do I have hydrated and soft skin but the texture and color are looking better too! I’d always been iffy on facial oils initially because I worried that they would make me break out, but Sunday Riley’s have such incredible formulas

Even though other reviewers mentioned the smell I didn’t find it to be that strong. Frankly when it comes to fragrance free skincare, I have come to expect them to smell a little funky. It doesn’t smell like flowers but it’s also definitely not the nastiest smelling fragrance free vitamin c product on the market (looking at you drunk elephant’s C Firma serum) 

I will say, I don’t know that I’d recommend it for super oily skin or anyone who doesn’t like the dewy glow type of look, but for anyone who likes using facial oils this is hands down my favorite.

It’s formula is gentle enough to work up to use nightly and is mostly hydrating enough for most skin types.
I will say, it can be a tad drying for super dry skin like mine, but if you just combine it with their Juno superfood oil or a similar hydrating oil, it’s perfect. 

Unlike other reviewers I have not had any issues with the color transferring onto clothing or pillowcases. Even when I accidentally spilled a drop or two onto a shirt it didn’t stain.

A little goes a long way with this oil, as with most facial oils, they recommend just a few drops for the whole face and I tend to do closer to 8 or 10 to cover my neck as well. Those with oilier skin types would probably be fine with 4 of 5 drops but my skin sucks up product so quickly I tend to use a bit more. 

I also love that it absorbs quickly and while my skin usually looks dewy (which i love) after I apply all my skincare, it doesn’t last more than 15 minutes so for anyone worried it’ll leave them feeling too shiny, I didn’t see that problem at all

Firstly, I gave it 2 stars because it didn't do anything for me (I explain below why its formulation doesn't even really make it possible to substantiate its claims) but it also didn't harm my skin. I have pretty resilient skin however, and am not bothered by fragrance. 
Upon inspection of the ingredients list it becomes clear why it didn't do anything: the formula is basically water and essential oils. Essential oils can be very irritating so I'm perplexed as to why they would be recruited for a product aimed at soothing sensitive skin. ""Mushroom elixir"" is a misnomer because Chaga and reishi are some of the last ingredients on the list, meaning the ingredients in the lowest concentration. 
Anyone who says this absorbed well into your skin- well yeah, it's water... 
I suspect when the marketing claims this lotion/toner ""preps"" your skin for serums etc. it basically means that it gets your face wet, which a wet/damp face does allow ingredients to penetrate more successfully. This is why many products (and dermatologists, estheticians) are applied to a damp face, with the exception of vitamin A.
So in summary- if you like the step of a toner to wet your face before applying other serums/treatments/moisturizers, you aren't sensitive to fragrance, and you have the extra cash to fork over $50 for essential oils and water, then do you. But the reality is that your money is going more toward a sensorial experience with this one, which I completely understand. Skincare is a form of self-care and it should be enjoyed.",combination,fair

This serum is incredibly gentle and enjoyable to use, making it a luxurious (self care) addition to your skincare routine. However, if you are truly looking to fight hyper-pigmentation/texture concerns or even out and brighten your skin tone, I would recommend a different serum with more potent active ingredients. 

Pitera and niacinamide are the first few ingredients listed for this product, which is reassuring -- I do not doubt that over years and years of consistent use, your skin will very slowly and subtly transform with this serum. However, I personally do not have that patience (or wallet capacity), especially when there are significantly more potent and effective niacinamide products out there at a tiny fraction of this price.",normal,medium

Now not so much. I find the new formula substandard, it dries my skin and no longer justifies the price point. I might as well use any old anti-aging drugstore brand.

Look to your product before you look to the form of removal. I used makeup for years that was full of harmful ingredients and not natural. I would attempt to remove it with white wash cloths, and even upon bleaching the wash cloths, they would still remain stained the color of my foundation and eye makeup. Upon switching to makeup products with less harmful ingredients, I noticed this happened less, but still a little. I would still use soap with my washcloth to remove makeup off my skin, and even with bleach every so often, there would always be a light stain. With the makeup eraser, I don’t even need soap, I just need water and the makeup eraser cloth. AND the makeup eraser loses all stains when washed—not something that happened with any regular wash cloths I used. I’m sure if I used harmful products, my makeup eraser wouldn’t perform as well. However, if you use quality products, the makeup eraser is perfect. It removes all and any makeup with soap. If you use crap products that harm your skin, yeah this may not be perfect, nothing ever will be.

Let alone one by Sephora. It just didn’t work. And so much so I actually felt the need to leave a review. It may work for regular makeup, but not waterproof. I wear Bobbi Brown’s No Smudge Mascara which is known to be tough on the elements to begin with, but I thought at least something substantial would come off. Zilch. But I wasn’t ready to give up on it just yet (The great price! The available sizes!), so determined to make it work I tried a variety of ways of applying it. Directly with my hands. With a soaked tissue. With a classic cotton round. Putting it in a spray bottle and spraying it on for deeper penetration.  I tried different time variants too, waiting up to 1 minute 30 seconds. I even tried it in combination with Bioderma’s Sensibio Micellar Water (which is also recommended for its tough makeup removal), and I swear it removed less than the micellar water on its own.  Each time nothing removed my mascara fully, and most times I somehow managed to get the product in my eyes. Which btw- it DOES burn if you get it IN your eye. The only other make up I typically wear is tinted lip balm/gloss and The Creme Shop’s Macro brow, and this removes SOME of the Macro brow, so I think it MIGHT adequately remove most non-waterproof makeup. All in all I’m just pretty disappointed with this let down, and I don’t want you to be too…. Back to the drawing board.

I started getting really bad acne from wearing a mask all day at work (even after changing them 2x a day) Remembering what the brand rep told me I decided to give it a go finally, and I started spraying this on the inside of my mask and on my face during my lunch breaks in my car and it has made a big difference, as in not having a new breakout on my face by the end of the day!

I spray it on the inside of my mask to ""kill"" (allegedly) any bacteria accumulating from mouth germs and then on my face since the masks make my skin dry after a few hours. It really has helped in both aspects so I will be repurchasing the travel size to always have in my bag.

I put one less star because it's primarily made up of essential oils which can be bad for my sensitive skin in the long run, so I will be solely using this for wearing masks.

Like many other cleansing balms I have tried, I first massage the product onto my dry skin and then wet my hands a bit to massage the balm to slowly emulsify it to remove makeup. This product, no matter how much I massage with some water on my hands, the formula refuses to emulsify. It's a true ""oil and water does not mix"" type of situation. For the actual removal process, I feel like I tend to rely on the second part of my cleanse with either my foreo or a konjac sponge. It's a 1 star product for its purpose but gave 2 stars because the rich oils does leave my skin feeling smooth and soft afterwards. Bottom line, I wouldn't recommend this cleansing balm. Besides, there are so many great ones out there for a fraction of a price.",normal,medium

The great smell is gone. 
The wipes feel like cardboard and the exfoliating feels the same and the cleansing wipes now. 
They don’t take off makeup as well. 
There is a sticky residue left on my face after using. 
Quantity is now 25 instead of 20. 

I am thoroughly disappointed and sadly, will not repurchase. Time to find a new favourite.",oily,fair

I like them a lot--they are easy to take out of the packaging. The wipes are super soft to the touch and ideal for sensitive skin. They are much softer than drugstore wipes, and they are better than some of the other wipes that Sephora and ULTA sell. They have not made me break out yet. The softness of them is very comforting after a long day. 

However, they are very pricey. It costs over 70 dollars for a larger, or regular size pack of these. I do like these wipes and will continue to buy them because I like them, but you can get very similar luxurious makeup wipes that are in the 17 to 25 dollar price range, with a normal amount of wipes in them. I can't figure out why these are so highly priced and I was an esthetician years ago, so I do have basic knowledge of the skin (I've seen a lot of wipes before). I also think that for these specific wipes, the company should take the term ""cleansing"" out of the title. I have tried pricier wipes before that are ""self-cleaning"", or ""self-lathering"", which is where you rub both sides of the wipes together and the wipe lathers on it's own for a true clean. I like these wipes a lot, but the title is very misleading--these are not self-lathering wipes...I never saw any tinsy little bit of foam or self lather coming from them and that's with me vigorously rubbing both sides of the wipe together. 

So, I will keep buying these wipes (not to use every night but for some nights.), and I will keep using them--they are really nice wipes and they are gentle when taking eye makeup off, which is harder to find in a makeup wipe. I just think that the title is a little bit misleading (keep in mind that these do not self-clean or self-lather.), and that they are priced too high for what they are (even for a luxury based, pricier wipe...they are priced too high to not ""self-lather"".) Just my personal opinion. I would still purchase these wipes again though and I would recommend these wipes to friends.",normal,fair
