This product had great coverage that matched my skintone and covered up all of the red spots on my face. The color lasted all day long and didn't become an oily mess like most makeup I normally wear would do. The cream comes out with a thick appearance, but once I applied it to my skin the it didn't appear as thick and blended very well.

Didn't really hold up to the hype for me. I tried this mask to do something about my dark circles. I tried a consistent routine of applying an eye mask every one to two days for two weeks straight, but there was no significant change in my dark circles. The effect just kinda lasts for the day you apply the mask. It reduces appearance of wrinkles and makes the skin around your eyes look more hydrated and fresh. But it didn't seem to make my dark circles look less ""dark"" overtime. So this is more of a temporary fix in my opinion.",normal,olive

After waxing my upper/lower lip, I reached for this because it had been a while since I had last used it, and I wanted to shrink my blackheads/pores across my nose/cheeks. However, I should have avoided the areas on my face I had just waxed, bc I got mild chemical burns on the areas of fresh, new skin at the corners of my lips... Nothing that can't be fixed using Aquaphor, Cetaphil cream, and sunscreen, but still, I should have been smarter to avoid the damage. The blackheads/pores on my nose/cheeks are much smaller though, so at least that's a win. 

Just remember that this should be used alone to stay on the safe side. I would also avoid using this in combination with any other active ingredients (Vitamin C, Vitamin A (retinol/retinoids), etc.). I learned my lesson last night, and will remember to avoid using it after exfoliating/facial waxing, too. Hope this helps!",combination,olive

Its light on the skin, does not feel moist like other toners, which makes the drying longer. This ism light and dries up fast. The skin feels nice and does feel greasy for longer time. I have combination skin hence certain areas like around mouth dry ,forehead and nose is oily. This does not make my skin dry yet keeps the desired around oil controlled which is remarkable. I really like using this twice a day am and pm after cleansing.
My only con would the texture which is very light that I do realize how much is too much, I do not feel the toner on the skin and end up using more than required.

For weeks I have tried a multitude of products, washes, exfoliants, creams, organic sulfate free soaps with oils of tea tree, peppermint, gypsy tears, and sweat of 4 month old virgin lambs from the eastern shores New Zealand (not actually, but some of the ingredients get rather absurd).

Yesterday, after a fruitful spree at Sephora, I opted for yet another product to mostly likely add to my countertop graveyard of failed attempts to reach clear skin again. I tried it last night, just a thin layer as the directions prompted, and rubbed it onto my cheeks. Put some lotion on after and went to bed. I wasn't expecting much to be honest!

When I woke up this morning, even before looking in a mirror, I happened to touch my cheek. I immediately sprung out of bed and ran to the bathroom to see if what I felt was real or if I was dreaming. After just one use, my cheeks had not a spot of acne on them! Still a bit of redness from where some of the bad spots had been, but everything is smooth and soft and there's no bumps or speckles to be found! I'm actually so impressed, that I couldn't continue my day without sharing this small victory!

At about $33 for this teeny sized bottle, I'm not going to say this is cheap, but I only had to use so little so far and I'm going to go right ahead and say it was worth it. Unfortunately I don't have the guts to share a before and after photo, but I am going to keep using Clinique and hopefully the positive results continue!

I washed it off, and man the difference in my skin. It was very soft, the dry flaky areas were immediately gone and my pores were noticeably (to me) smaller.

",5,"Game-changer! No more acne, faded scars","I don't normally post reviews but this has been a game-changer for me. I've struggled with adult acne for years and have sensitive skin. Have never used peels before and was VERY skeptical to try this, worried it would cause me to break out or worsen existing pimples. After reading all the great reviews decided to buy the 14 day set. Have been using it every other day after washing my face at night and it has drastically improved my complexion. I'm in love with this product! It's faded a lot of my acne scars and has evened out my skin texture (which was incredibly rough from cystic acne scars). It also stops new pimples from fully forming. I haven't been acne-free in years and now I am! Yay! If I could give this 10 stars I would. Just bought the 30 day treatment. Expensive yes, but seriously worth every penny.",combination,olive
